In this notebook, I go through my conceptual model and decide which variables from PSRC I will use to test each part of the model. I will create a list of variables from each dataset level (household, person, travel, etc). Finally, I will use this list to select the variables from each dataset. 

# Intention
## Attitude

## Social Factors

## Affect

# Habit

# Context/Facilitating Conditions
These have an indirect effect on travel behavior choices through their impact on **intention** and **habit**. 




# Travel Behavior Indicator Variables
